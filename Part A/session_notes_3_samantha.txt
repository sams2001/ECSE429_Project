SUMMARY:
Adding an existing project to a category or vice versa is not allowed and throws errors, or does not work with these commands.
You can get todos from categories but it will always return an empty set rather than show the todos associated to this category. Should throw error.
Other testing needed to verify to test project-category associations with JSON and XML input, as these calls are not valid.
category => project relationship confirmed, and the opposite direction shown to be false as documented.

FUTURE TESTING:
	- Test with JSON and XML bodies
	- Test with NULL values
	- Verify correct HTTP status code
	- Verify response headers
	- Test tasks
